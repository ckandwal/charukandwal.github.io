<b>Hymn of Creation</b> 

>But, after all, who knows, and who can say  
Whence it all came, and how creation happened?  
the gods themselves are later than creation,  
so who knows truly whence it has arisen?  

>Whence all creation had its origin,  
he, whether he fashioned it or whether he did not,  
he, who surveys it all from highest heaven,  
he knows - or maybe even he does not know.

There are 1760 (just a random number) things that I come across everyday which I don't fully understand. This blog is my attempt to make a conscious effort to understand one thing at a time and to share that knowledge with you (the reader).
I sincerely hope that in this process, I will help someone in their endeavour to seek knowledge. I <b> DO NOT </b> claim to be an expert in any field and so I am always open to suggestions, corrections and criticism.
